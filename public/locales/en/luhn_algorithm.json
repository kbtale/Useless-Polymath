The Concept (ELI7)\nImagine you are typing your credit card number to buy a video game.\nThe number is super long (16 digits!). It is very easy to make a mistake (typo).\nThe computer is lazy. It doesn't want to ask the Bank \"Does this number exist?\" every time you make a typo. That takes too long.\n\nSo, the computer uses a **Secret Math Trick** called the **Luhn Algorithm**.\nIt looks at the numbers you typed and does a quick math problem.\n* If the answer ends in **0**, the computer says: \"Okay, this looks like a real card.\"\n* If the answer is anything else (like 2 or 7), the computer says: \"Stop! You typed it wrong.\"\n\nIt is not a security guard (it doesn't stop hackers). It is a **Spellchecker** (it stops typos).\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Rules of the Game\nTo check if a number is valid, follow these 4 steps exactly.\n\n**The Golden Rules:**\n1. **Start from the RIGHT** (The end of the number) and go Left.\n2. **The Hopscotch Rule:** You skip the first one, double the second, skip the third, double the fourth...\n3. **The \"Too Big\" Rule:** If you double a number and it becomes **10 or bigger**, you must shrink it. How? Add the two digits together (or subtract 9).\n * Example: Double 8 is 16. -> 1 + 6 = **7**.\n4. **The Grand Total:** Add all the numbers up. If the result ends in a **0** (like 40, 50, 60), it is VALID.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Calculation (Exhaustive Example)\nLet's check if the Account Number **79927398713** is valid.\n\n\n\n| Step | Digits (Right to Left) | Action | The Math | Final Number |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1** | **3** (Check Digit) | Keep it. | Just 3 | **3** |\n| **2** | **1** | **Double it!** | 1 x 2 = 2 | **2** |\n| **3** | **7** | Keep it. | Just 7 | **7** |\n| **4** | **8** | **Double it!** | 8 x 2 = 16 (Too big! 1+6) | **7** |\n| **5** | **9** | Keep it. | Just 9 | **9** |\n| **6** | **3** | **Double it!** | 3 x 2 = 6 | **6** |\n| **7** | **7** | Keep it. | Just 7 | **7** |\n| **8** | **2** | **Double it!** | 2 x 2 = 4 | **4** |\n| **9** | **9** | Keep it. | Just 9 | **9** |\n| **10** | **9** | **Double it!** | 9 x 2 = 18 (Too big! 1+8) | **9** |\n| **11** | **7** | Keep it. | Just 7 | **7** |\n\n**The Final Sum:**\n3 + 2 + 7 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 7 + 4 + 9 + 9 + 7 = **70**\n\n** The Verdict:**\nDoes **70** end in zero? **YES.**\nThis is a VALID number.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The \"Check Digit\" (How to find the missing number)\nSometimes, you have a number, and you need to *create* the last digit (the Check Digit) to make the total end in zero.\n\n**Example:**\nPayload: **1 2 3 4 x** (What is x?)\n1. Start from right (skipping x). Double 4 -> 8.\n2. Next is 3. Keep 3.\n3. Double 2 -> 4.\n4. Next is 1. Keep 1.\n5. Sum: 8 + 3 + 4 + 1 = **16**.\n6. How much to reach the next \"10\"? The next ten is **20**.\n7. 20 - 16 = **4**.\n8. **x = 4**. The full number is **1 2 3 4 4**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Native Mnemonics (English)\n\n* **\"Double Second, Nine is the Limit\"**\n * Start from the end.\n * Double every **Second** digit.\n * If it is greater than **Nine**, sum the digits.\n* **\"Right to Left, Double the Evens\"**\n * Move Right -> Left.\n * Positions 1, 3, 5 are odds (Keep).\n * Positions 2, 4, 6 are evens (**Double**).\n\n***\n\n#",
