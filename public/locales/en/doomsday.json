If you know what day of the week the magic chair sits on, you know the day for the whole room!\n\nEvery year has one special day of the week called **\"Doomsday\"**.\n* For **2024**, Doomsday is **Thursday**.\n* For **2025**, Doomsday is **Friday**.\n\nIf you know the Doomsday of the year, and the \"Magic Dates\" (Anchors) for each month, you can figure out any date.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Reference Tables (MEMORIZE THESE)\n\n### Table A: Days of the Week as Numbers\nWe count from Sunday (None-day) to Saturday.\n\n| Number | Day | Mnemonic |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **0** | Sunday | **Noneday** (Nun, Zero) |\n| **1** | Monday | **Oneday** |\n| **2** | Tuesday | **Twosday** |\n| **3** | Wednesday | **Treblesday** |\n| **4** | Thursday | **Foursday** |\n| **5** | Friday | **Fiveday** |\n| **6** | Saturday | **Sixaday** |\n\n### Table B: Century Anchors\nEvery century starts with a specific Doomsday anchor. This pattern repeats every 400 years.\n\n| Centuries | Anchor Day | Number | Mnemonic |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1600-1699 | Tuesday | 2 | -- |\n| 1700-1799 | Sunday | 0 | -- |\n| 1800-1899 | Friday | 5 | **F**ridays in the 1800s |\n| 1900-1999 | Wednesday | 3 | **We**-in-this-day (1900s) |\n| 2000-2099 | Tuesday | 2 | **Y-Tue-K** (Y2K) |\n| 2100-2199 | Sunday | 0 | Twenty-One-Sunday |\n| 2200-2299 | Friday | 5 | -- |\n| 2300-2399 | Wednesday | 3 | -- |\n\n### Table C: The \"Magic Dates\" (Anchors) for Each Month\nThese dates **ALWAYS** fall on the year's Doomsday.\n\n| Month | Magic Date | Mnemonic / Trick |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **January** | **3** (Common) / **4** (Leap) | 3rd year of the king (or Jan 4th on Leap years) |\n| **February** | **28** (Common) / **29** (Leap) | The last day of February is always Doomsday |\n| **March** | **14** | PI Day! (3.14) |\n| **April** | **4** | 4/4 (Even month) |\n| **May** | **9** | **9**-to-**5** Job (Month 5 is 9) |\n| **June** | **6** | 6/6 (Even month) |\n| **July** | **11** | **7**-Eleven Store (Month 7 is 11) |\n| **August** | **8** | 8/8 (Even month) |\n| **September** | **5** | 9-to-**5** Job (Month 9 is 5) |\n| **October** | **10** | 10/10 (Even month) |\n| **November** | **7** | 7-**Eleven** Store (Month 11 is 7) |\n| **December** | **12** | 12/12 (Even month) |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Calculate (Step-by-Step)\n\nLet's find the day of the week for: **July 20, 1969** (Moon Landing).\n\n### Step 1: Find the Century Anchor\nLook at the year **19**69.\n* Use Table B.\n* 1900-1999 is **Wednesday (3)**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Year's Doomsday\nLook at the last two digits: **69**.\nWe will use the \"Rule of 12\" (easiest for mental math):\n1.  **How many times does 12 fit in 69?** 5 times (5 x 12 = 60).\n2.  **What is the remainder?** 9 (69 - 60).\n3.  **How many times does 4 fit in the remainder (9)?** 2 times.\n4.  **Add them up:** 5 + 9 + 2 = **16**.\n5.  **Take away 7s from 16:** 16 - 7 = 9... 9 - 7 = **2**.\n6.  **Result:** 2.\n\nAdd this result (2) to the Century Anchor (Wednesday/3):\n* 3 + 2 = 5.\n* **The Doomsday for 1969 is Friday (5)**.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Month's Magic Date\n* Month: **July**.\n* Use Table C. The trick is \"7-Eleven\".\n* Magic Date = **July 11**.\n* Since the Year's Doomsday is Friday, **July 11 was a Friday**.\n\n### Step 4: Count to the Target Date\n* Target: **July 20**.\n* Magic Date: **July 11**.\n* Difference: 20 - 11 = **9 days**.\n* Remove weeks (7 days): 9 - 7 = **2 days**.\n* Count 2 days forward from Friday.\n* Friday -> Saturday (1) -> **Sunday (2)**.\n\n**Answer:** July 20, 1969 was a **Sunday**.",
