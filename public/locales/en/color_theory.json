They paint with **LIGHT**.\nImagine your screen is made of millions of tiny lamps.\nEach lamp has only **3 colored lightbulbs** inside:\n1. **R**ed\n2. **G**reen\n3. **B**lue\n\nThis is **RGB**.\n* If you turn them all **OFF**, it is **Black** (Darkness).\n* If you turn them all **ON** (Full blast), they mix together to make pure **White** light.\n\n**The Secret Code (Hexadecimal)**\nInstead of a switch from 0 to 100, computers use a \"double digit\" code from **00** to **FF**.\n* **00** = Off (Dead darkness).\n* **80** = Halfway bright.\n* **FF** = Full Power (Blinding bright).\n\nThe code is always 6 digits:\n**#RRGGBB**\n(Amount of Red) (Amount of Green) (Amount of Blue)\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Logic of Mixing Light (How to Deduce)\nForget mixing paint (where Red + Green = Brown). **Light is different.**\n\n### The 3 Primary Rules\n1. **Red + Green = YELLOW** (Imagine the sun).\n2. **Green + Blue = CYAN** (Electric water).\n3. **Blue + Red = MAGENTA** (Bright Pink/Purple).\n\n### The Deduction Steps\nTo guess any color code, ask these 3 questions:\n\n**Step 1: Which color is the Boss?**\n* If it's Reddish, the first two digits are **FF**.\n* If it's Greenish, the middle two are **FF**.\n* If it's Blueish, the last two are **FF**.\n\n**Step 2: Is it Light or Dark?**\n* **Bright/Pastel:** You need to add light to the *other* colors. Raise the zeros to AA or CC.\n* **Dark/Deep:** Lower the main color from FF to 80 or 40.\n\n**Step 3: Is it Mixed?**\n* **Orange?** It's Red + a little Green. (FF 80 00).\n* **Purple?** It's Blue + a little Red. (80 00 FF).\n* **Grey?** All lights are equal, but dim. (80 80 80).\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Exhaustive Reference Table (Anchor Points)\nMemorize these \"Anchors\" and you can guess anything in between.\n\n| Color Name | The Recipe (Logic) | Hex Code (#RRGGBB) | RGB Values |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Black** | All lights OFF | **#000000** | (0, 0, 0) |\n| **White** | All lights FULL | **#FFFFFF** | (255, 255, 255) |\n| **Red** | Only Red is ON | **#FF0000** | (255, 0, 0) |\n| **Green** | Only Green is ON | **#00FF00** | (0, 255, 0) |\n| **Blue** | Only Blue is ON | **#0000FF** | (0, 0, 255) |\n| **Yellow** | Red + Green | **#FFFF00** | (255, 255, 0) |\n| **Cyan** | Green + Blue | **#00FFFF** | (0, 255, 255) |\n| **Magenta** | Red + Blue | **#FF00FF** | (255, 0, 255) |\n| **Silver** | All equal (Medium Bright) | **#C0C0C0** | (192, 192, 192) |\n| **Grey** | All equal (Dim) | **#808080** | (128, 128, 128) |\n| **Maroon** | Red, but dark (Half power) | **#800000** | (128, 0, 0) |\n| **Olive** | Yellow, but dark (R+G Half) | **#808000** | (128, 128, 0) |\n| **Green (Dark)** | Green, but dark (Half power) | **#008000** | (0, 128, 0) |\n| **Teal** | Cyan, but dark (G+B Half) | **#008080** | (0, 128, 128) |\n| **Navy** | Blue, but dark (Half power) | **#000080** | (0, 0, 128) |\n| **Purple** | Magenta, but dark (R+B Half) | **#800080** | (128, 0, 128) |\n| **Orange** | Full Red + Half Green | **#FFA500** | (255, 165, 0) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Native Mnemonics (English)\n\n* **\"RGB is 1-2-3\"**: The order never changes. Red first, Green middle, Blue last.\n* **\"F is for Full\"**: If you see F, the light is blindingly bright.\n* **\"Zero is Zero light\"**: If you see 0, it's pitch black.\n* **\"Yellow is Mean\"**: Yellow is made of Red and Green (RG).\n* **\"Cyan is Submarine\"**: Cyan is made of Green and Blue (GB) like the ocean.\n\n***\n\n#",
