When we run out of fingers, we add a \"1\" to the left (10). This is called **Decimal**.\nRobots and computers don't have fingers. They have **switches**.\nA switch only has two positions:\n* **0** = OFF (No electricity)\n* **1** = ON (Electricity)\nThis is called **Binary** (Bi = Two).\nTo count big numbers using only 0 and 1, robots use \"Magic Boxes\". Each box is worth **double** the box before it.\n---\n## 2. The \"Magic Boxes\" Reference Table (Powers of 2)\n**MEMORIZE THIS SEQUENCE.**\nTo read or write binary, you must draw these boxes on a piece of paper, starting from the **RIGHT** and moving **LEFT**. Each number is the previous number times 2.\n| Box # (Bit) | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Value** | **1024** | **512** | **256** | **128** | **64** | **32** | **16** | **8** | **4** | **2** | **1** |\n---\n## 3. How to Translate: Binary to Decimal\n**The Mission:** Read the robot number **10110** and find out what it means in human numbers.\n**Step 1: Draw the Boxes**\nWrite the Magic Box values (1, 2, 4, 8, 16...) from **Right to Left**.\n**Step 2: Put the Robot Number inside**\nPlace the binary number **10110** into the boxes, starting from the **Right**.\n| Value | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Binary**| **1** | **0** | **1** | **1** | **0** |\n| **Status**| **ON** | OFF | **ON** | **ON** | OFF |\n**Step 3: Add the \"ON\" Boxes**\nIgnore the zeros (OFF). Only add the numbers where there is a **1**.\n* We have a 1 at **16**.\n* We have a 1 at **4**.\n* We have a 1 at **2**.\n**Math:** 16 + 4 + 2 = **22**.\n**Answer:** 10110 in binary is **22** in decimal.\n---\n## 4. How to Translate: Decimal to Binary\n**The Mission:** Turn the human number **50** into robot code.\n**Step 1: The \"Shopping\" Game**\nImagine you have exactly **$50** in your pocket. You can only buy the items in the Magic Boxes (Values: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1). You must start from the big numbers.\n**Step 2: Ask \"Can I afford this?\"**\n1. **Box 128:** Can you afford $128 with $50? **NO**.\n * Write **0**.\n2. **Box 64:** Can you afford $64 with $50? **NO**.\n * Write **0**.\n3. **Box 32:** Can you afford $32 with $50? **YES!**\n * Write **1**.\n * *Pay the money:* 50 - 32 = **18 left**.\n4. **Box 16:** Can you afford $16 with $18? **YES!**\n * Write **1**.\n * *Pay the money:* 18 - 16 = **2 left**.\n5. **Box 8:** Can you afford $8 with $2? **NO**.\n * Write **0**.\n6. **Box 4:** Can you afford $4 with $2? **NO**.\n * Write **0**.\n7. **Box 2:** Can you afford $2 with $2? **YES!**\n * Write **1**.\n * *Pay the money:* 2 - 2 = **0 left**.\n8. **Box 1:** Can you afford $1 with $0? **NO**.\n * Write **0**.\n**Step 3: Collect the Code**\nThe code is: **110010** (We usually ignore the leading zeros).\n**Answer:** 50 is **110010** in binary.\n---\n## 5. Memory Tricks (Mnemonics)\n* **\"The Doubling Dance\":** To make the table, just sing \"One plus One is Two, Two plus Two is Four...\"\n* **\"Right is Light\":** Always start writing your values (1, 2, 4...) on the **Right** hand side. If you start on the left, you will fail.\n* **\"Off is Zero, On is Hero\":** Only count the numbers that have a 1 (Hero) under them.\n***\n#"
