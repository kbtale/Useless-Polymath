  "guide": "# Subnetting: Cutting the Network Pizza\n\n## 1. The Concept (ELI7)\nImagine the Internet is a giant city.\n* **IP Address:** This is your **House Address** (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).\n* **Subnet Mask:** This tells the mailman which part of the address is the **Street Name** (Network) and which part is Your **House Number** (Host).\n* **CIDR (/24):** This is a shortcut. It tells you how big the street is. A smaller number (like /8) means a HUGE street with millions of houses. A big number (like /30) means a tiny alley with only 2 houses.\n\n**The Four Key Pieces:**\n1. **Network Address:** The name of the street (The very first number). No one lives here, it's just the sign.\n2. **Broadcast Address:** The neighborhood loudspeaker (The very last number). If you shout here, everyone hears it.\n3. **Usable Hosts:** The actual houses where people live.\n4. **Subnet Mask:** The rulebook that defines the size.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Exhaustive CIDR Cheat Sheet\n**Use this table first.** Look at the number after the slash `/` (the CIDR).\n\n* **Total IPs:** All numbers in the bag.\n* **Usable IPs:** Total minus 2 (We subtract the Street Sign and the Loudspeaker).\n\n| CIDR | Subnet Mask | Total IPs | Usable IPs (Houses) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **/1** | 128.0.0.0 | 2,147,483,648 | 2,147,483,646 |\n| **/2** | 192.0.0.0 | 1,073,741,824 | 1,073,741,822 |\n| **/3** | 224.0.0.0 | 536,870,912 | 536,870,910 |\n| **/4** | 240.0.0.0 | 268,435,456 | 268,435,454 |\n| **/5** | 248.0.0.0 | 134,217,728 | 134,217,726 |\n| **/6** | 252.0.0.0 | 67,108,864 | 67,108,862 |\n| **/7** | 254.0.0.0 | 33,554,432 | 33,554,430 |\n| **/8** | 255.0.0.0 | 16,777,216 | 16,777,214 |\n| **/9** | 255.128.0.0 | 8,388,608 | 8,388,606 |\n| **/10** | 255.192.0.0 | 4,194,304 | 4,194,302 |\n| **/11** | 255.224.0.0 | 2,097,152 | 2,097,150 |\n| **/12** | 255.240.0.0 | 1,048,576 | 1,048,574 |\n| **/13** | 255.248.0.0 | 524,288 | 524,286 |\n| **/14** | 255.252.0.0 | 262,144 | 262,142 |\n| **/15** | 255.254.0.0 | 131,072 | 131,070 |\n| **/16** | 255.255.0.0 | 65,536 | 65,534 |\n| **/17** | 255.255.128.0 | 32,768 | 32,766 |\n| **/18** | 255.255.192.0 | 16,384 | 16,382 |\n| **/19** | 255.255.224.0 | 8,192 | 8,190 |\n| **/20** | 255.255.240.0 | 4,096 | 4,094 |\n| **/21** | 255.255.248.0 | 2,048 | 2,046 |\n| **/22** | 255.255.252.0 | 1,024 | 1,022 |\n| **/23** | 255.255.254.0 | 512 | 510 |\n| **/24** | 255.255.255.0 | 256 | 254 |\n| **/25** | 255.255.255.128 | 128 | 126 |\n| **/26** | 255.255.255.192 | 64 | 62 |\n| **/27** | 255.255.255.224 | 32 | 30 |\n| **/28** | 255.255.255.240 | 16 | 14 |\n| **/29** | 255.255.255.248 | 8 | 6 |\n| **/30** | 255.255.255.252 | 4 | 2 |\n| **/31** | 255.255.255.254 | 2 | 0 (Point-to-Point) |\n| **/32** | 255.255.255.255 | 1 | 0 (Single Host) |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Calculate (The \"Magic Number\" Method)\n\nLet's solve for this address: **192.168.10.50 / 26**\n\n### Step 1: Find the \"Interesting Octet\"\nAn IP address has 4 parts (Octets). Look at your CIDR (/26).\n* **1 - 8:** Working in the 1st part.\n* **9 - 16:** Working in the 2nd part.\n* **17 - 24:** Working in the 3rd part.\n* **25 - 32:** Working in the 4th part.\n\n**/26** is between 25 and 32. So we are working in the **4th Octet** (The last number: `.50`).\n*Keep the first three parts the same:* **192.168.10.xxx**\n\n### Step 2: Find the Subnet Mask\nLook at the table above for **/26**.\n**Mask:** `255.255.255.192`\n\n### Step 3: Find the \"Magic Number\" (Block Size)\nTake the number **256** (Always 256) and subtract the last number of the Mask.\n* Math: 256 - 192 = **64**.\n* **Your Magic Number is 64.** This means each street has 64 houses.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Network Address (The Street Sign)\nCount by your Magic Number (64) until you get close to your IP (.50) without going over.\n* 0, 64, 128, 192...\n* Where does **50** fit? It fits between **0** and **64**.\n* The \"Floor\" is **0**.\n* **Network Address:** `192.168.10.0`\n\n### Step 5: Find the Broadcast Address (The Loudspeaker)\nTake the next block (64) and subtract 1.\n* 64 - 1 = **63**.\n* **Broadcast Address:** `192.168.10.63`\n\n### Step 6: The Usable Range\nIt's everything in between the Network and the Broadcast.\n* Start: Network + 1 -> `192.168.10.1`\n* End: Broadcast - 1 -> `192.168.10.62`\n\n---\n\n## 4. Native Mnemonics (English)\n\n* **\"256 is the Fix\":** To find the block size, always subtract the weird subnet number from 256.\n* **\"The Floor and the Ceiling\":**\n * **Floor:** The Network ID (Round down to the multiple).\n * **Ceiling:** The Next Network.\n * **Broadcast:** Ceiling minus 1.\n\n***\n",
