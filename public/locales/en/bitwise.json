  "guide": "# Bitwise Operations: The Robot's Control Panel\n## 1. The Concept\nComputers are made of tiny switches called **Bits**.\n* **0** = OFF\n* **1** = ON\nSometimes, we want to play with these switches. We don't want to add numbers (1 + 2 = 3). We want to say: \"If **Switch A** AND **Switch B** are on, turn on the light.\"\nThis is called **Bitwise Operations**. It's like a game of \"Simon Says\" for robots. We compare bits from two different numbers to create a new number.\n---\n## 2. The 6 Magic Tools (The Operators)\nWe have 6 tools to change the switches. Here is how they work.\n### Tool 1: AND (`&`) - The \"Strict Guard\"\nThe Guard only says **YES (1)** if **BOTH** people have a ticket.\nIf one person forgets their ticket, the answer is **NO (0)**.\n**Truth Table (The Rules):**\n| Bit A | Bit B | Result (A & B) | Meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 0 | 0 | **0** | No tickets = No entry |\n| 0 | 1 | **0** | One missing = No entry |\n| 1 | 0 | **0** | One missing = No entry |\n| 1 | 1 | **1** | **Both have tickets! Enter.** |\n**Real Example:**\n* Top Number: `1 0 1 0`\n* Bot Number: `1 1 0 0`\n* **Result:** `1 0 0 0` (Only the first column had two 1s).\n---\n### Tool 2: OR (`|`) - The \"Nice Guard\"\nThe Guard says **YES (1)** if **AT LEAST ONE** person has a ticket.\nHe only says NO if **nobody** has a ticket.\n**Truth Table (The Rules):**\n| Bit A | Bit B | Result (A \\| B) | Meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 0 | 0 | **0** | Nobody has a ticket. |\n| 0 | 1 | **1** | Someone has a ticket! |\n| 1 | 0 | **1** | Someone has a ticket! |\n| 1 | 1 | **1** | Everyone has a ticket! |\n**Real Example:**\n* Top Number: `1 0 1 0`\n* Bot Number: `1 1 0 0`\n* **Result:** `1 1 1 0`\n---\n### Tool 3: XOR (`^`) - The \"Picky Eater\"\nXOR stands for \"eXclusive OR\".\nThis Guard likes things to be **DIFFERENT**.\n* If bits are **Different**, the answer is **YES (1)**.\n* If bits are the **Same** (both 0 or both 1), the answer is **NO (0)**.\n**Truth Table (The Rules):**\n| Bit A | Bit B | Result (A ^ B) | Meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 0 | 0 | **0** | Same (Boring!) |\n| 0 | 1 | **1** | **Different! (Yes)** |\n| 1 | 0 | **1** | **Different! (Yes)** |\n| 1 | 1 | **0** | Same (Boring!) |\n**Real Example:**\n* Top Number: `1 0 1 0`\n* Bot Number: `1 1 0 0`\n* **Result:** `0 1 1 0`\n---\n### Tool 4: NOT (`~`) - The \"Rebel\"\nThis tool only takes **ONE** number. It flips everything upside down.\n* If it sees 0, it makes it 1.\n* If it sees 1, it makes it 0.\n**Truth Table (The Rules):**\n| Bit A | Result (~A) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 0 | **1** |\n| 1 | **0** |\n**Real Example:**\n* Number: `1 0 1 0`\n* **Result:** `0 1 0 1`\n---\n### Tool 5: Left Shift (`<<`) - The \"Conveyor Belt\"\nImagine the numbers are boxes on a belt moving to the **Left**.\n* The numbers fall off the left side.\n* Empty spaces on the right are filled with **0**.\n* *Secret Power:* This multiplies the number by 2!\n**Example: Shift `0011` (Number 3) Left by 1 spot (`<< 1`)**\n1. Start: `0 0 1 1` (3)\n2. Move: `0 1 1 _`\n3. Fill: `0 1 1 0` (6)\n---\n### Tool 6: Right Shift (`>>`) - The \"Conveyor Belt\"\nImagine the numbers are boxes on a belt moving to the **Right**.\n* The numbers fall off the right side.\n* Empty spaces on the left are filled with **0**.\n* *Secret Power:* This divides the number by 2!\n**Example: Shift `0110` (Number 6) Right by 1 spot (`>> 1`)**\n1. Start: `0 1 1 0` (6)\n2. Move: `_ 0 1 1`\n3. Fill: `0 0 1 1` (3)\n---\n## 3. Memory Mnemonics (English)\n* **AND**: \"St**AND** together.\" (Both must stand up).\n* **OR**: \"M**OR**e is okay.\" (If you have more than 0, you win).\n* **XOR**: \"X marks the difference.\" (Only Yes if they differ).\n* **Shift Left**: \"To the Left, To the Left, everything you own gets **Bigger** (Multiplied).\"\n***\n#"
