  "guide": "# The Hi-Lo System: Beating the Casino at Blackjack\n## 1. The Concept (ELI7)\nImagine a bag of candy mixed with rocks.\n* **Candy (High Cards - 10, J, Q, K, A):** You want these! They make you win (Blackjack).\n* **Rocks (Low Cards - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):** You hate these! They make the dealer win.\nThe **Hi-Lo System** is just keeping a score in your head.\n* When you see a **Rock** leave the bag, the bag gets BETTER (because only candy is left). So you add **+1**.\n* When you see a **Candy** leave the bag, the bag gets WORSE (because the good stuff is gone). So you subtract **-1**.\nIf your score is **HIGH** (like +10), bet lots of money! The bag is full of candy.\nIf your score is **LOW** (like -5), bet little money. The bag is full of rocks.\n---\n## 2. The Exhaustive Value Table (Every Card)\nYou must memorize the value for every single card rank.\n| Card Rank | Value | Why? (The Logic) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **2** | **+1** | It's a \"Rock\". Good that it is gone. |\n| **3** | **+1** | It's a \"Rock\". |\n| **4** | **+1** | It's a \"Rock\". |\n| **5** | **+1** | It's a \"Rock\" (The dealer loves 5s, we hate them). |\n| **6** | **+1** | It's a \"Rock\". |\n| **7** | **0** | Neutral. Ignore it. |\n| **8** | **0** | Neutral. Ignore it. |\n| **9** | **0** | Neutral. Ignore it. |\n| **10** | **-1** | It's \"Candy\". Sad that it is gone. |\n| **Jack (J)** | **-1** | It's \"Candy\". |\n| **Queen (Q)** | **-1** | It's \"Candy\". |\n| **King (K)** | **-1** | It's \"Candy\". |\n| **Ace (A)** | **-1** | It's \"Candy\" (The best card!). |\n---\n## 3. The Math (Running Count vs. True Count)\nCounting in your head is step 1. But Casinos use **Multiple Decks** (usually 6 or 8).\n**Step 1: The Running Count**\nThis is the score you keep in your head round after round.\n* Example: You see `2, 5, K, Q`.\n* Math: `+1` (2) `+1` (5) `-1` (K) `-1` (Q) = **0**.\n**Step 2: The True Count (The Real Score)**\nImagine you have a score of **+10**. That sounds great!\nBUT, if there are **6 decks** of cards left in the shoe, that +10 is diluted (like one spoon of sugar in a swimming pool).\nYou must divide.\n**Formula:**\n`Running Count ÷ Decks Remaining = True Count`\n**Example:**\n* Running Count is **+12**.\n* You look at the shoe and see about **2 decks** left.\n* 12 ÷ 2 = **+6**.\n* **True Count is +6.** (Now you bet BIG!).\n---\n## 4. Native Mnemonics (English)\n* **\"Low is High\"**: When you see Low cards (2-6), the count goes **High** (+).\n* **\"High is Low\"**: When you see High cards (10-A), the count goes **Low** (-).\n* **\"The 7-8-9 Don't Shine\"**: 7, 8, and 9 are zeros. They don't matter.\n***\n#",
